Harmonica Programming Language

## This is a course project PLT-Fall2016 at Columbia University.

## Target
We are implementing a mixture of Go-Python language that supports functional programming and concurrency based on OCaml -> LLVM.

## Example
A functional and parallel programming languange is perfect for scientific computing on large data sets over distributed system, i.e., large matrix / data frame manipulation, signal processing (embarrasingly parallel).
